  <h3>PAST  PROJECTS </h3>
	  <h4>U01  Mulago III Parish Cohort Study: Longitudinal comparison of antimalarial  treatment efficacy</h4>
	  <p><i>Study  period:</i> November 2004  to December 2008. <i>Brief description:</i> This randomized, single-blinded, longitudinal clinical trial was designed to  compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of three different combination  antimalarial regimens for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. The study  revealed that AL was superior to other anti-malarial combinations. <i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research  Collaboration. <i>Sponsored by</i>: The  National Institutes of Health/Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases  (NIH/DMID) </p>
      
    <h4>Pharmacokinetics of Antimalarial  Medications in Ugandan Children</h4>
    <p> <i>Study period:</i> June 2007 to December 2008. <i>Brief description:</i> This study  investigated the pharmacology of artemether/lumefantrine and  artesunate/amodiaquine in HIV un-infected children in Kampala, Uganda.  The comparison to prior adult data suggests  that LR exposure is lower in children and that AQ/DEAQ exposure is similar in  children and adults.  For the artemisinin  drugs, differences between exposure in children and adults vary depending on  which artemisinin is administered. PK distinctions between children and adults  should be considered to optimize dosing strategies for these widely utilized  ACT regimens. <i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF  Research Collaboration. <i>Sponsored by</i>:  CFAR, Drug Research Unit. (It is not clear whether the one who wrote this  summary was reviewing past data or actually presenting what our study found. It  needs to be edited by the author and he/she should include more of the  findings.)</p>
    
    <h4>CHAMP:  The Children with HIV and Malaria Project</h4>
    <p><i>Study  period: October </i>2005  to May 2009. <i>Brief description:</i> The  aim of this study was to study the interactions between Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (HIV) infection and malaria in African children.  CHAMP has led to several important  discoveries about malaria and HIV. In addition with such close clinical  follow-up, CHAMP has also provided an opportunity to better understand other  aspects of the disease HIV causes in African children. <i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research Collaboration. <i>Sponsored by:</i>  National  Institute of Health (NIH)(Even for CHAMP, we need to list the &ldquo;several&rdquo;  important findings that we got.)</p>
    
      <h4>TB-VCT:  HIV Voluntary Counseling and Testing for TB Evaluation Patients and their  Family and Household Members in Kampala Uganda</h4>
      <p><i>Study  period:</i> August 2007  to March 2012. <i>Brief description:</i> The  project aimed to determine the uptake of and barriers to HIV VCT among TB  evaluation patients as well as comparing VCT uptake between Home-based VCT and  TB Clinic-based VCT for family and household members of TB evaluation patients.  This project has shown that it is feasible to carry HIV testing of households  of subjects at high risk of testing HIV positive in this resource limited  setting, although invariably showing that home HIV testing was superior to  clinic based HIV testing  for  successfully  testing household members.  Predictors of successful Household Testing were, testing at Home Vs Clinic  (aOR, 4.0, (1.6-6.2), higher household size and household member being female.  The highest yield of HIV positive among household members was a spouse of an  HIV positive TB evaluation subject. These results provide a working model of  TB/HIV VCT that could be rapidly implemented across sub-Saharan Africa given  the substantial pre-existing TB control infrastructure in the region. <i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research Collaboration. <i>Sponsored by:</i> The National Institute  of Health (NIH)</p>
      
      <h4>FRESH-AIR:  The Impact of Household Ventilation on Transmission of Tuberculosis among  Household Contacts of Active Tuberculosis Patients in Kampala, Uganda</h4>
      <p><i>Study  period:</i> July 2010 to  December 2011. <i>Brief description:</i> This pilot study tested the feasibility of an in-home measurement of  ventilation using a carbon dioxide (CO2) tracer gas decay technique, a low cost  method, and evaluated if household ventilation is associated with TB in  household contacts of adults with pulmonary TB (PTB) in Uganda. Findings  indicated that Measuring household ventilation was feasible and Ventilation  rates were lower (although not statistically significant) in homes with versus  without co-prevalent TB in household contacts.<i> Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research Collaboration. <i>Sponsored by:</i> UCSF Center for AIDS  Research (CFAR)</p>
      
    <h4>TCC  - Tororo Child Cohort: Interaction between HIV and malaria in African Children</h4>
    <p><i>Study  period:</i> August 2007  to March 2013. <i>Brief description</i><i>:</i> The study was  designed to; assess whether trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(TMP/SMX) prophylaxis is highly  effective in preventing malaria in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected  children, assess the effect of TMP/SMX prophylaxis on selection of malaria  parasites containing mutations confering resistance to antifolate  drugs,and  compare the efficacy, safety  and tolerability of artemether-lumefantrine(AL) and  dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine(DP) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum  malaria among HIV-infected and uninfected children. The study demonstrated that  TMP/SMX prophylaxis reduced the incidence of malaria by 39% and there was no  difference in prevalence of markers of antifolate resistance in children who  were on TMP/SMX prophylaxis compared to those who were not and that both DP and  AL were equally efficacious and safe for treatment of uncomplicated malaria.<i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research  Collaboration. <i> Sponsored by:</i> The Doris Duke Charitable  Foundation, Center for Disease Control (CDC)</p>
    <h4>Access  Bottlenecks Costs and Equity Study </h4>
    <p><i>Study  period:</i>  April 2012 to December 2012. <i>Brief description</i><i>:</i> To understand the constraints to  health service delivery, determinants of patient access and policies which  affect both supply and demand of health care in Uganda. <i>Collaborators:</i> Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). <i>Sponsored by:</i> Bill and Melinda Gates  Foundation</p>
    
    <h4>Serial  HIV Testing Study: Acceptability and Feasibility of Serial HIV Antibody Testing  to Detect Incident HIV Infection during Pregnancy and Lactation and Partner  Testing in Tororo, Uganda</h4>
    <p><i>Study  Period:</i> January 2011  to December 2011. <i>Brief description:</i> To determine the proportion of women who complete serial HIV antibody testing.  The integration of a serial HIV testing program into routine antenatal and  postnatal health care visits was highly acceptable to pregnant women. However,  the majority of women only partially completed the serial testing  protocol.  Thus, a less intensive serial  HIV testing protocol such as 1 repeat test in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy  and 1 repeat test at 6 months postpartum may be more feasible.  <i>Collaborators:</i> MU-UCSF Research Collaboration. <i>Sponsored  by:</i> UCSF Gladstone Institute for Virology and Immunology, Center for AIDS  Research (CFAR)</p>
    
    <h4>A  Programmatic Evaluation of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine for Prevention of  Placental Malaria in Uganda</h4>
    <p> <i>Study  period:</i> February 2011  to July 2011. <i>Brief description:</i> To  determine whether the current program of routine SP administration is effective  in reducing placental malaria in Tororo, Uganda. Findings: In this area of  Uganda with high malaria transmission intensity, use of &gt; 2 doses of SP was  not associated with protection against placental malaria and improved birth  outcomes compared with &lt; 2 doses of SP. These findings highlight the need  for alternatives to SP for the protection against malaria in pregnant women in  areas of moderate-to-high malaria transmission and with widespread SP  resistance<i>.

   <h4>Pharmacokinetics  of Piperaquine and Lumefantrine in Young Children in Tororo Uganda</h4>
   <p><i>Study  period:</i> March 2008 to  2012. <i>Brief description:</i> The aim of  this study is to provide information on drug disposition and the relationship  between drug exposure and outcomes.  In  addition, the impact of factors such as weight and concomitant medications on  PK exposure will also be evaluated. <i>Collaborators: </i>MU-UCSF Research Collaboration. <i>Sponsored  by:</i> Novartis, Inc., Holley-Cotec Pharmaceuticals</p>
